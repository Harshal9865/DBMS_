 # Project Overview
Project Title: InfoHub

# Project Purpose
To design and implement a normalized database system for an NGO to manage operations like:
Donor registrations & donations
Event management
Volunteer allocation
Beneficiary services
Various types of surveys (Educational, Health, Environmental, Economical)

# Key Features
Admin Login & Department Management
Donor Records & Donation Timeline
Volunteer Assignment to Projects
Event and Crew Coordination
Beneficiary and Aid Distribution Tracking
Survey Data Collection & Classification

# Core Entities & Relationships
Donors donate to Projects
Admins manage Departments
Departments run Projects and Events
Event Managers manage Event Crews
Participants attend Events
Volunteers help in Projects
Beneficiaries receive Aids
Surveys are conducted across various domains and tied to projects or regions

# ER Diagram Summary
The ER diagram consists of ~20+ entities such as:
Donors, Admins, Volunteers, Events, Participants, Event Managers, Event Crews
Surveys and their types: Educational, Environmental, Health, Economical
Many-to-many and 1-to-many relations handled using junction tables like Participates_in, Donation_timeline, Aids, etc.

# Database Design Highlights
All relations are normalized to BCNF. Examples:
Donors: donor_id is the key with full donor detail
Donation_timeline: Composite key (donor_id, donation_date)
Volunteers, Projects, Events all use a clear primary key strategy
Survey tables are split into domain-specific tables (health, education, etc.) with metadata stored separately (e.g., survey_info)

# Key Tables (Schema Snapshots)
1. Donors

donor_id (PK), donor_name, email_id, donor_contact_details, donor_addrs_state, ...
2. Projects

project_id (PK), project_name, budget_allocated, income_source, dept_code (FK), ...
3. Survey

survey_region (PK), survey_time (PK), dept_code (FK), survey_region_population

# Normalization Summary
All major tables are in Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
Each entity has clear primary keys and well-defined functional dependencies
Minimal redundancy and strong data integrity

# Technologies Used
SQL (likely MySQL/PostgreSQL)
ER modeling tools (e.g., dbdiagram.io or draw.io)
GitHub for version control
IEEE format for documentation
